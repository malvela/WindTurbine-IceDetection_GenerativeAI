# Rotor Blade Icing Detection - still in Private Mode
Supplementary material for the research work "Domain-Invariant Icing Detection on Wind Turbine Rotor Blades with Generative AI for Deep Transfer Learning" (in submission).


A repository with code for predicting blade icing on images of rotor blades using supervised (conventional CNNs) and unsupervised (with neural style transfer and CycleGAN) techniques.

## Download and use of the repository:
To download this repository and its submodules use

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/malvela/WindTurbine-IceDetection_GenerativeAI.git

## Individual files and functionality:
This repository contains Python files for generalised icing prediction (domain-invariant - independent of the wind park the AI model has been trained on) on wind turbine rotor blades using a tiny computer.
